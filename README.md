# ISLRv2_Python

## Vision :cowboy_hat_face:	
This repository aims to present implement the R code in [2nd edition of Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLRv2_website.pdf) with Python.
Note that we will priortize in writing the code for those new materials in the 2nd edition. 

## Setup :robot:
We use [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html) for virtual environment. You can first install `pipenv` with 
```
pip install pipenv
```

Now you can create a new virtual environment with 
```
pipenv install
```

Finally, you can activate your virtual environment with 
```
pipenv shell
```

After this setup, you should be able to reproduce the result from this repo.
